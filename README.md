# Creating a Google Hangouts Chatbot connected to SAP Graph API

*<<Disclaimer: though I am a current employee at Google and former employee at SAP, I am not a developer and the code below shall not serve as a productive version and can only support proof-of-concept. Also, the opinions expressed in this article are my own and do not reflect the official opinion or positioning of Google or SAP>>*

**Note:** The Hangouts Chat application, and the developer platform, are only available to G Suite accounts. You will not be able to develop or test a bot with an @gmail.com account.

This code builds a connection betweem Google Hangouts Chat and the SAP Graph API.
